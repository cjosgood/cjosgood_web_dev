            As you are looking at things, you come across a sheet of paper flipped over on the floor. 
            Examinining it more closely, it appears to be a combination for something.

        <code>
            Guys... I think I found something.
        </code>
        <p> 
            You, Chad, and Jessica search around upstairs looking for what the combination could possibly go to.
